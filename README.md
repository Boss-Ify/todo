# Todo App with Bonus Features

A simple Todo application built with React. This app allows users to manage their tasks by adding, editing, deleting, marking tasks as completed, and filtering tasks by their completion status. It also includes pagination for better task management. The bonus features add modals for adding and editing tasks and the ability to toggle tasks between "completed" and "pending" statuses.
